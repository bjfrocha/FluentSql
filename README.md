# FluentSql for Dapper

FluentSql is a Micro ORM that creates Sql statements using a Sql like syntax in C#. The goal of this ORM is to provide an easy way to create and execute Sql statements allowing for fast data access development.

FluentSql is designed to work of the information that the system already provides. On start up, it reads the database metadata and caches this data for use at runtime. Being this way, there is no need to add/ update attributes in your models. This means less code and faster development time.


## Features

1. Models do not need any attributes.
2. Use C# code to create your Sql statements.
3. It saves coding time by using one API for all queries.
